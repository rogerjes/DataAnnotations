# Easy Form Validation with Data Annotations
Form validation is a crucial aspect of any application that collects user input. It ensures that the data entered by users meets specific criteria, helping to maintain data integrity and improve the user experience.

In .NET, **data annotations** provide a simple and effective way to enforce validation rules on model class properties. This repository demonstrates how to use data annotations for form validation in an **ASP.NET Core MVC** application.

Easy Form Validation with Data Annotations

Form validation is a crucial aspect of any application that collects user input. It ensures that the data entered by users meets specific criteria, helping to maintain data integrity and improve the user experience.

In .NET, data annotations provide a simple and effective way to enforce validation rules on your model class properties. (Model classes are simply C# classes representing data structures like database tables in your application. They transfer data between the user interface and the database.)
